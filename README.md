# Odin-Library

This is the **library** project of the The Odin Project. (See: [Project Library](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library)) 
In this project the aim is to build a library to practise and use JavaScript Prototypes, which were learned in the lessons beforehand.
